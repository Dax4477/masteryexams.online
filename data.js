Maybe the question is 'Which is NOT a tributary of Ganga?' and the OCR missed 'അല്ലാത്തത്'. If it is 'NOT', then Sutlej (Indus) and Manas (Brahmaputra) are answers. This is ambiguous. Let's look at the key again. Key 3 is C. C is Sutlej. So the question must be 'Which is NOT a tributary of Ganga?'. I will output based on Key C with the correction in Question text.)"
